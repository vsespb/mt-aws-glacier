mt-aws-glacier
==============
Perl Multithreaded multipart sync to Amazon Glacier service.

## Intro

Amazon Glacier is an archive/backup service with very low storage price. However with some caveats in usage and archive retrieval prices.

mt-aws-glacier is a client application for Glacier.

## Version

* Version 0.82 beta (See [ChangeLog][mt-aws glacier changelog])

[mt-aws glacier changelog]:https://github.com/vsespb/mt-aws-glacier/blob/master/ChangeLog

## Features

* Does not use any existing Amazon Glacier library, so can be flexible in implementing advanced features
* Glacier Multipart upload
* Multithreaded upload
* Multipart+Multithreaded upload
* Multithreaded retrieval, deletion and download
* Tracking of all uploaded files with a local journal file (opened for write in append mode only)
* Checking integrity of local files using journal
* Ability to limit number of archives to retrieve
* File name and modification times are stored as Glacier metadata
* Ability to re-create journal file from Amazon Glacier metadata
* UTF-8 support

## Coming-soon features

* Multipart download (using HTTP Range header)
* Use journal file as flock() mutex
* Checking integrity of remote files
* Upload from STDIN
* Some integration with external world, ability to read SNS topics
* Simplified distribution for Debian/RedHat
* Split code to re-usable modules, publishing on CPAN (Currently there are great existing Glacier modules on CPAN - see [Net::Amazon::Glacier][Amazon Glacier API CPAN module - Net::Amazon::Glacier] by *Tim Nordenfur*) 
* Create/Delete vault functions


[Amazon Glacier API CPAN module - Net::Amazon::Glacier]:https://metacpan.org/module/Net::Amazon::Glacier 

## Planned next version features

* Amazon S3 support

## Important bugs/missed features

* Zero length files are ignored
* Only multipart upload implemented, no plain upload
* No way to specify SNS topic 
* HTTP only, no way to configure HTTPS yet (however it works fine in HTTPS mode)

## Production ready

* Not recommended to use in production until first "Release" version. Currently Beta.

## Installation/System requirements

Script is made for Linux OS. Tested under Ubuntu and Debian. Should work under other Linux distributions. Not tested under Mac OS.
Should NOT work under Windows. 

Install the following CPAN modules:

* **LWP::UserAgent** (or Debian package **libwww-perl**)
* **JSON::XS** (or Debian package **libjson-xs-perl**)
		
Install using *apt-get* (easier, more reliable way):
				
				apt-get install libwww-perl libjson-xs-perl
				
Install using *cpan* (if you like Perl and want use latest versions of libraries):

				cpan -i LWP::UserAgent JSON::XS


## Warnings ( *MUST READ* )

* When playing with Glacier make sure you will be able to delete all your archives, it's impossible to delete archive
or non-empty vault in amazon console now. Also make sure you have read _all_ Amazon Glacier pricing/faq.

* Read their pricing [FAQ][Amazon Glacier faq] again, really. Beware of retrieval fee.

* With low "partsize" option you pay a bit more (Amazon charges for each upload request)

* With high partsize*concurrency there is a risk of getting network timeouts HTTP 408/500.

* Memory usage (for 'sync') formula is ~ min(NUMBER_OF_FILES_TO_SYNC, max-number-of-files) + partsize*concurrency

* For backup created with older versions (0.7x) of mt-aws-glacier, Journal file **required to restore backup**.


[Amazon Glacier faq]:http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#How_will_I_be_charged_when_retrieving_large_amounts_of_data_from_Amazon_Glacier

## Usage
 
1. Create a directory containing files to backup. Example `/data/backup`
2. Create config file, say, glacier.cfg

				key=YOURKEY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
				secret=YOURSECRET                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
				region=us-east-1 #eu-west-1, us-east-1 etc

3. Create a vault in specified region, using Amazon Console (`myvault`)
4. Choose a filename for the Journal, for example, `journal.log`
5. Sync your files

				./mtglacier.pl sync --config=glacier.cfg --from-dir /data/backup --to-vault=myvault --journal=journal.log --concurrency=3
				
6. Add more files and sync again
7. Check that your local files not modified since last sync

				./mtglacier.pl check-local-hash --config=glacier.cfg --from-dir /data/backup --to-vault=myvault -journal=journal.log
    
8. Delete some files from your backup location
9. Initiate archive restore job on Amazon side

				./mtglacier.pl restore --config=glacier.cfg --from-dir /data/backup --to-vault=myvault --journal=journal.log --max-number-of-files=10
    
10. Wait 4+ hours for Amazon Glacier to complete archive retrieval
11. Download restored files back to backup location

				./mtglacier.pl restore-completed --config=glacier.cfg --from-dir /data/backup --to-vault=myvault --journal=journal.log
    
12. Delete all your files from vault

				./mtglacier.pl purge-vault --config=glacier.cfg --from-dir /data/backup --to-vault=myvault --journal=journal.log

## Restoring journal

In case you lost your journal file, you can restore it from Amazon Glacier metadata

1. Run retrieve-inventory command

				./mtglacier.pl retrieve-inventory --config=glacier.cfg --vault=myvault

2. Wait 4+ hours for Amazon Glacier to complete inventory retrieval

3. Download inventroy and export it to new journal:

 				./mtglacier.pl download-inventory --config=glacier.cfg --vault=myvault --new-journal=new-journal.log


For files created by mt-aws-glacier version 0.8x and higher original filenames will be restored. For other files archive_id will be used as filename. See Amazon Glacier metadata format for mt-aws-glacier here: [Amazon Glacier metadata format used by mt-aws glacier][Amazon Glacier metadata format used by mt-aws glacier]

[Amazon Glacier metadata format used by mt-aws glacier]:https://github.com/vsespb/mt-aws-glacier/blob/86031708866c7b444b6f8efa4900f42536c91c5a/MetaData.pm#L35

## Additional command line options

1. "concurrency" (with 'sync' command) - number of parallel upload streams to run. (default 4)

				--concurrency=4
				
2. "partsize" (with 'sync' command) - size of file chunk to upload at once, in Megabytes. (default 16)

				--partsize=16
				
3. "max-number-of-files" (with 'sync' or 'restore' commands) - limit number of files to sync/restore. Program will finish when reach this limit.

				--max-number-of-files=100

## Test/Play with it

1. create empty dir MYDIR
2. Set vault name inside `cycletest.sh`
3. Run

		./cycletest.sh init MYDIR
		./cycletest.sh retrieve MYDIR
		./cycletest.sh restore MYDIR

OR

		./cycletest.sh init MYDIR
		./cycletest.sh purge MYDIR
